# Reverse your String
Write a function called ReveX that takes a string as input, and return a new string with the same letters in reverse order.
Don’t use the .reverse() method, that would be too simple.

# Solve the Factorial
Write a method called FactorX that takes an integer n a input and returns its factorial. Remember the formula of a factorial of a number
                               n! = n ∗ (n − 1) ∗ (n − 2) ∗ (n − 3) ∗ ... ∗ 1
# The Longest word
Write a function called longest that takes a string (preferably a sentence) as input and returns the longest word in the string. You may assume that the string contains only letters and spaces.

# Sum over my predecessors
Write a function called SumOverX that takes an integer as input and returns the sum over all the integers between zero and that integer, including it.

# Four Digits Magic
Take any four-digit number,x. Rearrange the digits to make the largest possible number called x max . Also rearrange the digits to make the smallest possible number,x min . There is only one four-digit number for which
                                                   x max −x min = x
Find it.

# From minutes to Conventional Time
Write a function called ClockX that takes as input a certain number of minutes,and returns a string that formats the number into ‘hours:minutes‘.

# Vowel Digger
Write a function called VoweX that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. You may assume that all the letters are lower cased. You can treat ”y” as a consonant.

# Military Time
Write a function called Military that takes the time as string in AM/PM format and convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note: Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock, and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock, and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
